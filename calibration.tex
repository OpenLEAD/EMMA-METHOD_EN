\section{Calibration}


\subsection{Calibration of the Robot}

The attachment of markers on the manipulator and base can be performed with
precision and repeteability, therefore reflecitve spheres were choosen to serve
as reference in the process of localization of the manipulator in respect to the
environment, or the sensor.

Given the low ambient light inside the hidraulic circuit.

Hough transform to localize the spheres \cite{hough2014}

\subsection{Blade Calibration}

The localization of the blade shows a different scenario, because it is much
more complex to explore artificial markers as reference points. The attachment
of the markers, inside the turbine and with enough precision,  in known
positions of the blade would need a calibration process itself. Therefore the
intrinsec spacial caractheristics of surface of the blade must be used 
reference points.
