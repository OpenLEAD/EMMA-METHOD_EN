\section{Introduction}

Cavitation and abbrasion 

HVOF coating protect the blade and avoid or reduce the effects of the cited
phenomena. 

There is the need of dry the turbine, disassemble the ``arc chamber'', the
rotor, transport the blades to the coating site in order to coat the blade.
The time of stopped machine would be too long to justify any repair and
another.

ESBR, UFRJ (COPPETEC) and RIJEZA are working together in a R\&D project to
be able to coat the turbine \textit{in situ}, without the need of dissassembling
the entire turbine and reducing the time of maintenance.

Concept and technical viability in the first phase and later implementation and
field tests
