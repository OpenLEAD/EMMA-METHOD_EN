\section{General Overview}

The access is limited and in the context of the Hidreletric Powerplant of Jirau
the coating system must pass through a $800mm$ hatch and due HSE it must operate
without the human presence inside the turbine. 

The final concept is a manipulator of limited size, due the logistic and
access limitation, on a modular rail in order to compensate the limited reach
presented by the robot.

The rail is divided in two main parts: primary and secondary rail.
Primary rail is responsible of trasnporting the robot from the hatch to the
region near the rotor and the blades and the secondary one allows the robot to
be placed alongside the blade, in order to reach all the areas to be processed.

Magnets bases are applied to maintain the rails attached to the mettalic surface
of the turbine and also withstand the forces and torques generated by the
manipulator during operation.
